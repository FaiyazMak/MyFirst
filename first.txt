Thi is my first tutorial with git 
and so this is my first version.

some linux commands:
pwd : present working directory of our terminal...it shows the folder into which we are executing the commands presently.
ls : list show ...shows all the files and folder of present working directory.
cd : change directory...we can shift our terminal to any folder by using this...basically cahnges pwd of terminal.
rm -rf : it is command used to delete particular folders and files.rm -rf : it is command used to delete particular folders and files.
rm -rf .git : deleats the .git folder and thus deletes all the tracking of the project folder. i.e delets the present git directory.
ls -la : shows all the folders of our git directory.

git 
it is distributed version controlling system, which can tract all the changes made to developing project where u can also rollback 
to previous versions.

git as three stage architecture:
working directory : the current working files of all the versions.
staging area : files are send to staging area which are to be commited.
git directory/repository : all the versions of the project which is created after each commit are stored in this directory. 
 .git is that hidden git directory of the version controlling folder.

git starting commands:
git : just shows about git and all he command to be used by it.
git init : initializes the git to the current project folder and all the files into that folder is tracked.
git config --global user.name"Faiyaz"
git config --global user.email"faiyaz.dmak@gmail.com" : this above two commands is used to give your identity to git.
Global means git software stores the info for all projects without entering every time. 

commands to work on--
git init : makes the current folder as git tracking directory i.e any changes in that folder will be tracked.
git status : shows how many files are not tracked uptodate..which files has been modified , which files has been send to staging area. 
 and in general how changes are uptotime.
git add --a : adds all the files to the staging area, to be commited.
git add anynameoffile : adds particular file to staging area.
git commit --m "anymessage" : commits the changes and saves it along with message.
git log : show all the versions of the folder uptodate.

git clone ParticularUrl : this clones particular repository from git hub into out local computer into provided folder i.e we can track that 
 particular code from git hub into our computer and can use it as our git repositiory.
git clone ParticularUrl . : this clones the git hub repository into the current open folder of our computer and not makes folder to clone it inside 
 that folder.

commands to ignore files in git:
touch filename : this creates files/folders in the repository folder i.e in the working folder
touch .gitignore : this creates a file in the working directory with name .gitignore ...
 create this file and write names of folders and files which u want to be ignored by git ...that simple.
git rm --cached filename : if particular file was tracked before and now u add it in .gitignore then that file will be not tracked from hereon but its history is 
 not removed from git depository...if it has history which takes lots of space then that causes problem ..so this commands deletes the history of that 
 file being added in .gitignore.
